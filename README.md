# project_triangle

Goal Pipeline:

1. Generate a graph (as laplacian matrix)
2. Put the graph through a graph neural network
3. Try to predict the heat kernel signature or eigenvalues (pretty similar things)

Subgoals:

1. Try to learn pytorch geometric
2. Think about how to address premutation
3. Write graph neural networks with pytroch geometric
