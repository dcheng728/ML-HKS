# Mesh Learning

This repository includes the code to adversarially train a contrastive neural network on 3D meshes. The performance of the contrastive neural neural network is benchmarked by comparing its clustering results to a classifier based on heat kernel signature. 

The main code is in the ContraNN+atkNN.ipynb file. This file contains detailed explanation of each step of the code (loading data, setting up neural network, defining hyper parameters, etc.) The various helper functions are located in the two helpers_...ipynb files with comments indicating their functions.
